/***
  Create the array of quote objects and name it `quotes`. - done
  Add at least five quote objects to the `quotes` array. - done
  Give each quote object a `quote` and `source` property.

  Recommended:
    - Add at least one `year` and/or `citation` property to at least one
      quote object.
***/




/***
  Create the `getRandomQuote` function to:
   - generate a random number
   - use the random number to `return` a random quote object from the
     `quotes` array.
***/




/***
  Create the `printQuote` function to:
   - call the `getRandomQuote` function and assign it to a variable.
   - use the properties of the quote object stored in the variable to
     create your HTML string.
   - use conditionals to make sure the optional properties exist before
     they are added to the HTML string.
   - set the `innerHTML` of the `quote-box` div to the HTML string.
***/




/***
  When the "Show another quote" button is clicked, the event listener
  below will be triggered, and it will call, or "invoke", the `printQuote`
  function. So do not make any changes to the line of code below this
  comment.
